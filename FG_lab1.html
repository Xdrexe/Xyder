        <u>[verse 1]</u><br>
        I can't remember when you weren't there<br>
        When I didn't care for anyone but you<br>
        I swear we've been through everything there is<br>
        Can't imagine anything we've missed<br>
        Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do<br>
        <br>
            <br>
            <u>[chorus 1]</u><br>
        Through the years, you've never let me down<br>
        You've turned my life around<br>
        The sweetest days I've found, I've found with you<br>
        Through the years, I've never been afraid<br>
        I've loved the life we've made and I'm so glad I've stayed<br>
        Right here with you through the years<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>[verse 2]</u><br>
        I can't remember what I used to do<br>
        Who I trusted, whom I listened to before<br>
        I swear you've taught me everything I know<br>
        Can't imagine needing someone so<br>
        But through the years it seems to me<br>
        I need you more and more<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>[chorus 2]</u><br>
        Through the years, through all the good and bad<br>
        I know how much we had<br>
        I've always been so glad to be with you<br>
        Through the years, it's better every day<br>
        You've kissed my tears away as long as it's okay<br>
        I'll stay with you through the years<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>[chorus 3]</u><br>
        Through the years, when everything went wrong<br>
        Together we were strong<br>
        I know that I belong right here with you<br>
        Through the years, I never had a doubt<br>
        We'd always work things out, I've learned what love's about<br>
        By loving you through the years<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>[chorus 1]</u><br>
        Through the years, you've never let me down<br>
        You've turned my life around<br>
        The sweetest days I've found, I've found with you<br>
        Through the years, it's better every day<br>
        You've kissed my tears away as long as it's okay<br>
        I'll stay with you through the years</center>
